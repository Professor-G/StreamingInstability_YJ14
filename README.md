# Effects of Optically Thick Regions in Protoplanetary Disks 

An analysis of the numerical simulations of planetary formation model via streaming instability performed by [Yang & Johansen (2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5995.pdf)

We explore the observational implications of optically thick regions in protoplanetary disks. Our work includes a radiative transfer analysis, for details see the [documentation](https://streaminginstability-yj14.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
